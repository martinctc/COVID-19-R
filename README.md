# COVID-19-R
Minimal COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) dashboard built using RMarkdown and flexdashboard

This is a minimal prototype to build COVID-19 dashboard using the {RMarkdown} and {flexdashboard} packages. In addition, this dashboard showcases a few other visualisation packages and HTML widgets in R.

The data used to build the analysis is taken from the data repository for the **2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard**, operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE). Their GitHub repo is linked below:
